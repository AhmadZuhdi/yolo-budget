# Firebase Deployment Guide

## Setup

The project is configured to deploy to Firebase Hosting with the following structure:

- **Build folder**: `dist/` (generated by Vite)
- **Public assets**: `public/` (icons, static files)
- **Firebase config**: `firebase.json`

## Deployment Commands

### 1. Build the project
```bash
npm run build
```

### 2. Deploy to Firebase Hosting
```bash
npm run deploy
```

Or deploy manually:
```bash
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

### 3. Preview before deploying (optional)
```bash
firebase hosting:channel:deploy preview
```

## Configuration

### firebase.json
- **public**: `dist` - Points to Vite's build output
- **rewrites**: Configured for SPA routing (all routes → index.html)

### .firebaserc
Contains your Firebase project ID configuration.

## Important Notes

- Always run `npm run build` before deploying
- The `dist/` folder is git-ignored (see `.gitignore`)
- Static assets in `public/` are automatically copied to `dist/` during build
- Service worker and PWA manifest are auto-generated by `vite-plugin-pwa`

## First-time Setup

If you haven't initialized Firebase yet:

1. Install Firebase CLI globally:
```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

2. Login to Firebase:
```bash
firebase login
```

3. Initialize Firebase project (if needed):
```bash
firebase init hosting
```

Select:
- Existing project or create new one
- Public directory: `dist`
- Configure as SPA: Yes
- Setup automatic builds: No (we use Vite)

## Troubleshooting

- If deployment fails, ensure you're logged in: `firebase login`
- Check Firebase project is correct: `firebase projects:list`
- Verify build succeeded: check `dist/` folder exists with content
